                On the first day of summer holiday, my uncle asked me to visit his summer house and spend the summer with him and his kids. I said yes and that’s how I ended up in a beautiful summer house next to a beautiful beach in Lombok. I also went to some beaches.

                During summer, my cousins and I went to some different beaches that are so amazing. The first beach we visited was Gili Trawangan Beach. We went snorkeling and I saw the most beautiful marine biota for the first time in forever. They’re so gorgeous that I wanted to be there with them forever.

                On the next day, we visited an extremely unique beach named Pink Beach. It has a pink colored sand and is framed with cliffs. We also went swimming and diving in that very beautiful beach that has clear water. I wish I had some more time so I can visit some other beaches in Lombok with my cousins.

                Cerita Bahasa Inggris Liburan Bersama Keluarga
                Berikut beberapa contoh cerita Bahasa Inggris liburan ke berbagai daerah di Indonesia.

                Cerita Bahasa Inggris Liburan ke Jogja
                My mom’s parents lived in Jogja, a small yet unique city. We spent our last holiday in my grandparents’ house. My grandpa loved to cycle everywhere. He had an old bicycle that has lots of history. He said he went on dates with grandma on that very old bike. He was a romantic man.

                He also had a newer one. I used that bike to cycle with my grandpa every time we visited him in Jogja. We cycled through Malioboro Street, the most famous tourist destination in Jogja. And we visited Sultan’s Palace which is an old Javanese building that is so wonderful.

                In the evenings, my grandma made us some fried bananas and a pot of hot tea. We gathered in the backyard of my grandparents’ old house, listened to grandma as she told us the same story of how she met grandpa during the war. We never get bored of that story since we love them so much.

                Cerita Bahasa Inggris Liburan ke Bali
                Mom always wanted to visit Bali, so we went to Bali last month during the holiday. We took the cheapest flight since we went together: Mom, Dad, my brothers Rudi and Ruslan, my sister Rita, and me. Then we stayed on a small but unique homestay near Kuta Beach in Denpasar.

                Dad decided to rent a car so we could go wherever we want easily and practically. On our second day in Bali, we went to Marigold Field in Temukus Village. It was the most beautiful field I’ve ever seen. It is located in the east part of Bali, close to the holiest temple in Bali.

                Then on the next day, we went to Musi Village where we found a wonderful waterfall. The village is located in Buleleng. The waterfall was surrounded by the rocks and cliffs. It was totally concealed. Yet, the villagers would love to help us by showing the route we must take to find that waterfall.
